\chapter{Integrated Circuitry Design}
This chapter presents the design of the read-out circuit and the simulation results.


\section{Architecture}
The review of source follower in section.\ref{section:SF} suggests the constant current method for the circuit of DC measurement.
The data analysis from chapter 3 supports it by the linear relation between $I_D$ and $g_m$.
However, the section.\ref{sec:AC} shows that source follower is not suitable for AC measurement.
It alternatively recommends the circuit in Fig.\ref{fig:lockin} which measures ac current signal and converts it into voltage output.
This circuit is appealing because of its noise suppression, simplicity and flexibility.

We combined these two method into one circuit structure and will introduce it in the section below.
